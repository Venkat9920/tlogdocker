        Note: A value of 10000 for maxBackoutCount coupled with a 
              rollBackDelay of 10000 ms. means the flow will run
              for about 69.5 days before shutting down.

      enableMaxBackoutCount:
        Defines whether or not a message flow will automatically shutdown
        when the "maxBackoutCount" has been reached on a message. The 
        implication is that the destination is unavailable and the appropriate
        alert should be generated when the flow stops.
        
        In a recovery situation, the value should be set temporarily to
        'false' to allow the message to be delivered (it will exceed the
        backout count), and then set back to 'true' after the recovery
        completes.
        
        Changing of the value should occur in the store specific configuration
        file (SigServiceConfig.xml) and not in this file.

        has changed, it will be reloaded. A value of 0 indicates 
        that the configuration file will be checked on each access
        of the configuration as to whether or not it has changed.
        A more reasonable value is 900000 which will cause the
        file to be check at 15 minute intervals. Note that a 
        check to determine if the file has changed is essentially
        a 'stat' call and not a reload of the configuration (that
        would be just plain inefficient).
